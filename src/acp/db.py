	If the user has set an explicit database path in the `$ACP_DB_HOME`
	environment variable, then the database path is `$ACP_DB_HOME/db.sqlite3.
	Otherwise, default to `$XDG_DATA_HOME/acp/db.sqlite3`.  If `$XDG_DATA_HOME`
	doesn't exist, then use `$HOME/.local/share/acp/db.sqlite3`.  If `$HOME`
	does not exist, then the path used is `~/.local/share/acp/db.sqlite3`.

	If `~` is the first component of the path, then the OS is queried to
	resolve it to an absolute path.

	If parent directories do not exist, they are created.  No explicit
	permissions will be specified (the umask will effectively set permissions).

	This function is memoized, so the checks only happen on the first call, and
	the result is cached.  All subsequent calls (within this run of the
	program) will use the cached result.
